Provides a simple and extensible back end for the Minneapolis Institute of Arts' open-source iPad presentation software, Griot.

== Description ==

= About Griot for iPad =

Griot is an open-source iPad application that facilitates engagement with a collection of *objects* (artifacts, artwork, graphs, or anything else that can be represented visually) through *annotations* (points of interest on the object itself) and *stories* (related text-based and multimedia content, presented as a series of pages).

The Griot framework has three parts:

1. The Griot software itself ([get it on GitHub](http://artsmia.github.com/griot));
2. A server for creating and serving tiled and static images; and
3. An interface (such as GriotWP) for loading content and bundling it in JSON format.

= About GriotWP =

GriotWP is a free WordPress plugin that creates a simple and extensible environment for loading relational and text-based content -- essentially, everything except media -- and providing it to the Griot application.

Specifically, GriotWP creates:

*   Three new post types: Objects, Stories, and Griot (hidden).
*   A user-friendly, code-free interface for entering content and setting up relationships.
*   Semantic XHTML templates for tweaking and extending the editing environment.
*   An endpoint (/griot/) for exposing entered data in JSON format.

GriotWP can be installed on top of an existing WordPress site.

== Installation ==

If you're not familiar with WordPress, read the [Getting Started documentation.](http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress)

Install GriotWP as you would any other WordPress plugin. 

1. Upload the griotwp folder to your WordPress plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Log in to WordPress and activate GriotWP in the Plugins menu.
3. Navigate to Options -> GriotWP and either paste or link to your **image configuration object.**

= Image Configuration Object =

The **image configuration object** is a JSON object that gives the system an overview of all images available for inclusion as Objects or related media.

A sample image config can be found in the /sample/ folder.

If an image config is not defined, the user must enter explicit URLs for both zoomable and generic images.
